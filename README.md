The Dice Game React Project is a simple web application built using React.js to simulate a dice rolling game. The project allows users to roll dice and get random outcomes, where the app typically generates a random number between 1 and 6 for each dice roll. It might include features such as displaying the result visually with dice images, tracking scores, and allowing users to play a turn-based game (like "Pig" or a basic dice game with rules). The primary focus is on demonstrating React's state management, component structure, and handling user interactions.
